## How to use

An ES6 native replacement for `select` using standards Bootstrap 5 (and 4) styles.

No additional CSS needed! Supports creation of new tags.

```js
import Tags from "./tags.js";
Tags.init();
// Tags.init(selector, opts);
// You can pass global settings in opts that will apply
// to all Tags instances
```

By default, only provided options are available. Validation error
will be displayed in case of invalid tag.

```html
<label for="tags-input" class="form-label">Tags</label>
<select class="form-select" id="tags-input" name="tags[]" multiple>
  <option disabled hidden value="">Choose a tag...</option>
  <option value="1" selected="selected">Apple</option>
  <option value="2">Banana</option>
  <option value="3">Orange</option>
</select>
<div class="invalid-feedback">Please select a valid tag.</div>
```

## Creation of new tags

Use attribute `data-allow-new` to allow creation of new tags. Their
default value will be equal to the text. Since you can enter
arbitrary text, no validation will occur.

```html
<select class="form-select" id="tags-input" name="tags[]" multiple data-allow-new="true"></select>
```

You can force these new tags to respect a given regex.

_NOTE: don't forget the [] if you need multiple values!_

## Server side support

You can also use options provided by the server. This script expects a json response that is an array or an object with the data key containing an array.

Simply set `data-server` where your endpoint is located. It should provide an array of value/label objects. The suggestions will be populated upon init
except if `data-live-server` is set, in which case, it will be populated on type. A ?query= parameter is passed along with the current value of the searchInput.

```html
<label for="validationTagsJson" class="form-label">Tags (server side)</label>
<select
  class="form-select"
  id="validationTagsJson"
  name="tags_json[]"
  multiple
  data-allow-new="true"
  data-server="demo.json"
  data-live-server="1"
>
  <option disabled hidden value="">Choose a tag...</option>
</select>
```

## Options

Options can be either passed to the constructor (eg: optionName) or in data-option-name format.

## Tips

- You can also use it on single selects! :-)
- Use arrow down to show dropdown (and arrow up to hide it)
- If you have a really long list of options, a scrollbar will be used
- Access Tags instance on a given element with Tags.getInstance(mySelect)

## Without Bootstrap 5

### Bootstrap 4 support

Even if it was not the initial idea to support Bootstrap 4, this component is now compatible with Bootstrap 4 because it only
requires minimal changes.

Check out demo-bs4.html

### Standalone usage

Obviously, this package works great with the full bootstrap library, but you can also use it without Bootstrap or with a trimmed down version of it

Actually, this library doesn't even use the js library to position the dropdown menu, so its only dependencies is only on css classes.
You can check out the .scss file to see how to reduce bootstrap 5 css to a smaller size.

Check out demo-standalone.html
